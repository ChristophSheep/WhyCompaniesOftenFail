* Authorities expect to much from people under them what they self can not do
* People leave and new people do not understand the code what before did before
* Core product or libraries are not stable and thick enough to hold future business
* Choosing the wrong to complicated technology, because everyone else use it
* People have no wisdom in programming with got lost over the last 30 years (2019)
