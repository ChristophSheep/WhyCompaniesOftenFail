# Why companies often fail - DRAFT

## Thoughts

* Hiring young unexperienced people that are not called to be programmers or called but not grown enough
* Authorities not know and not understand what their people really produce because they can not read the code
* Putting young unexperienced people under pressure with less specification (on old messed up system)
* Authorities expect to much from people under them what they self can not do
* Often the wrong people are in authority, because their are have a louder voice (like in school)
* Leaders are not see poeple under that are better as enemy instead and good team member for whole team
* People leave and new people do not understand the code and design ideas behind
* Core products or libraries are not stable and foundation is not thick enough to hold future business
* Choosing the wrong to complicated technology, because everyone else use it
* People have no wisdom in programming, which got lost over the last 30 years (2019)
* People do not seek the hidden wisdom of programming that got lost over the last 30 decades in programming
* People do not produce clean code and do not care
* Having people in charge are not called to be in that position
* Company was grown to fast, foundation not set right
* Authorities does not understand that their people are very important
* Authorities does not understand that maintaince of old software can bring you down
* It easy to write new software, it is not easy to maintain it (and not mess it up) over many years
* Software needs permanent care like a child (BugFixing, stabelizing, refactoring, Make it simpler)
* Programmer use their intelligence to create ultra complicate system that only they understand instead of creating ultra simple system that all can understand - Each fool can create a complicated system, but only the wise can handle a complex thing by divide it into simple parts that everyone can understand
* Ignoring the facts that old code has to be maintain
* Libraries should be written very stable because they are your backbone of your business
* A lot of code should be libraries and a small core. You business should be written like plugins to be flexible when business change
* Ignoring the fact the simple written documentation is very important because nobody remembers things also when people are not hear anymore
* Writting code is the smallest problem. The problem is to written that it works for the next 10 years. Maintainces costs are very high for bad written code. This can bring a company done.
