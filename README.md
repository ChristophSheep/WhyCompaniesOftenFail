# Why companies often fail

## Thoughts

* Hiring young unexpereienced people that are not called to nbe programmers
* Authority not know and understand what their people really produce
* Putting people under pressure with less specification 
* Authorities expect to much from people under them what they self can not do
* People leave and new people do not understand the code what before did before
