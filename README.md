# Why companies often fail

## Thoughts

* Hiring young unexperienced people that are not called to be programmers or called but not grown enough
* Authorities not know and not understand what their people really produce because they can not read the code
* Putting young unexperienced people under pressure with less specification (on old messed up system)
* Authorities expect to much from people under them what they self can not do
* People leave and new people do not understand the code and design ideas behind
* Core products or libraries are not stable and foundation is not thick enough to hold future business
* Choosing the wrong to complicated technology, because everyone else use it
* People have no wisdom in programming, which got lost over the last 30 years (2019)
* People do not seek the hidden wisdom of programming that got lost over the last 30 decades in programming
* People do not produce clean code and do not care
